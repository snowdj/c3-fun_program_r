# Agenda
* Thinking more about functional programming

	+ A small example

* Introduce you to {purrr} and contrast it with the base functions we learned last week

---
# Learning objectives
* Understand how `purrr::map` relates to `lapply` and `for` loops

* Understand the six basic variants of `purrr::map`, when they should be used,
and when they will fail

* Understand what functional programming is, and how `{purrr}` can help
facilitate the process

# Functional Programming

# What is FP?
> decomposing a big problem into smaller pieces, then solving each piece with a 
function or combination of functions

# Example
### Calculate top mpg manufactures

* First, we'll subset the data to 4 cylinders. This will be the dataset we'll
solve the problem on:

```{r four_cyl, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
four_cyl <- filter(mpg, cyl == 4)
```

---
* Next, we'll filter for cases where the city miles per gallon is in the top 10% (i.e.,greater than or equal to the 90th percentile).

```{r ninety-ptile}
ninety <- four_cyl %>%
	filter(cty >= quantile(cty, probs = 0.9))
ninety
```

---
* Now count the unique occurrences for each manufacturer,
manufacturer/model, and class

```{r counts}
count_manufacturer <- count(ninety, manufacturer)
count_model <- count(ninety, manufacturer, model)
count_class <- count(ninety, class)
```

---
* Produce a plot for each

```{r plots1}
plot_manufacturer <- 
	ggplot(count_manufacturer, aes(fct_reorder(manufacturer, -n), n)) +
		geom_col(aes(fill = manufacturer)) +
		scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
		labs(title = "Manufacturers",
		     x = "",
		     y = "") +
		guides(fill = "none")

plot_car <- count_model %>%
	unite(car, manufacturer, model, sep = " ") %>%
	ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(car, -n), n)) +
		geom_col(aes(fill = car)) +
		scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
		labs(title = "Top 10% of city mpg",
		     subtitle = "Car frequency",
		     x = "",
		     y = "") +
		guides(fill = "none")

plot_class <-
	ggplot(count_class, aes(fct_reorder(class, -n), n)) +
		geom_col(aes(fill = class)) +
		scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
		labs(title = "Car Class",
		     x = "", 
		     y = "") +
		guides(fill = "none")
```

---
# Assemble the plots

```{r patchwork, fig.width = 13, fig.height = 6.5}
library(patchwork)
plot_car / (plot_manufacturer + plot_class)
```

# Functional Programming Version
### At least in spirit

---
# Filter all
```{r filter}
by_cyl <- split(mpg, mpg$cyl)
top_10 <- lapply(by_cyl, function(x) {
	filter(x, cty >= quantile(cty, probs = 0.9))
})
str(top_10)
```

---
# All counts

```{r all-counts}
counts <- lapply(top_10, function(x) {
	count_manufacturer <- count(x, manufacturer)
	count_class <- count(x, class)

	count_model <- count(x, manufacturer, model) %>%
		unite(car, manufacturer, model, sep = " ")
	

	return(list(mfr = count_manufacturer, 
	            car = count_model, 
	            class = count_class))
})
str(counts)
counts
```

---
# Plots
### Let's write a couple functions
(I recognize we haven't talked about functions yet, but as a
preview...)

```{r plot_fun}
indiv_plot <- function(d, var) {
	p <- ggplot(d, aes_string(fct_reorder(d[[var]], -d[["n"]]), 
	                          d[["n"]])) +
		geom_col(aes_string(fill = var)) +
		scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set3") +
		labs(title = var,
		     x = "",
		     y = "") +
		guides(fill = "none")

	if(var == "car") {
		p <- p + labs(title = "Top 10% of city mpg",
		              subtitle = var)
	}
	return(p)
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r indiv_plot1, fig.width = 13}
indiv_plot(counts[["4"]]$mfr, "manufacturer")	
```	

---
```{r indiv_plot2, fig.width = 13}
indiv_plot(counts[["4"]]$car, "car")
```

---
```{r indiv_plot3, fig.width = 13}
indiv_plot(counts[["6"]]$class, "class")	
```

---
# Compile plots function

```{r plot2}
full_plot <- function(l) {
	indiv_plot(l[["car"]], "car") / (
	  indiv_plot(l[["mfr"]], "manufacturer") +
	  indiv_plot(l[["class"]], "class")
	)
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r full_plot-test, fig.width = 13}
full_plot(counts[[1]])
```

---
# Finish up

```{r looped-full-plot}
plots <- lapply(counts, full_plot)
```

---
```{r p1}
plots[[1]]
```

---
```{r p2}
plots[[2]]
```

---
```{r p3, fig.width = 25}
plots[[3]]
```


---
```{r p4}
plots[[4]]
```

map(1:3, rnorm)
```

# Comparison to `base::lapply`

### lapply

lapply(1:3, rnorm)
```
]

.pull-right[
### map
```{r map-lapply}
map(1:3, rnorm)
```
]

side note: What exactly is going on here?

---
> The base equivalent to map() is lapply(). The only difference is that lapply() does not support the helpers that you’ll learn about [next], so if you’re only using map() from purrr, you can skip the additional dependency and use lapply() directly.

\- [Adv R](https://adv-r.hadley.nz/functionals.html)

# Equivalents

The following are equivalent

```{r equivalents1, eval = FALSE}
map(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))

lapply(mtcars, function(x) length(unique(x)))
```

--
{purrr} also allows  you to specify anonymous functions more succinctly using the formula interface

```{r formula1}
map(mtcars, ~length(unique(.x)))
```

---
# Extracting elements
```{r list}
l <- list(
  list(-1, x = 1, y = c(2), z = "a"),
  list(-2, x = 4, y = c(5, 6), z = "b"),
  list(-3, x = 8, y = c(9, 10, 11))
)
```

--
### Extract second element from each

```{r map-extract}
map(l, 2)
```

---
### Doesn't work for `lapply`

```{r lapply-extract-fail, error = TRUE}
lapply(l, 2)
```

--
Instead, you have to apply an anoymous function

```{r lapply-extract-success1}
lapply(l, function(x) x[[2]])
```


---
Alternatively the following is also the same

```{r lapply-extract-success2}
lapply(l, `[[`, 2)
```

---
# Extract by name

```{r by_name}
map(l, "y")
```

---
# Multiple arguments

```{r by_name_arg}
map(l, list("y", 1))
```

# {purrr} variants

# Return a vector

* `map_int`
* `map_char`
* `map_lgl`

---

.pull-left[
```{r show-l}
str(l)
```
]

--

.pull-right[
```{r map_dbl1}
map_dbl(l, "x")
map_dbl(l, 1)
```
]

---
# Type match

* Coercion will occur if you request a different type

```{r mismatched-type-coercion}
map_chr(l, "x")
```

--
* You'll get an error if element doesn't exist

```{r no-element,error = TRUE}
map_chr(l, "z")
```

---
* Unless you set a default value

```{r no-element-default-val, error = TRUE}
map_chr(l, "z", .default = NA_character_)
```

---
# Quick note on missing values
* In the prior case, specifying `NA` would work, instead of `NA_character_`


--
* Generally, I think it's better to specify the type.


--
* .bolder[General programming rule:] The more strict the better (leads to fewer
unexpected results)

--
* Because (base) R likes to be inconsistent, here are they `NA` types

.pull-left[

| Type | NA value|
|:-----|:-------:|
| character | NA\_character\_ |
| integer   | NA\_integer\_ |
| double    | NA\_real\_ |
| logical   | NA (see [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19564748/why-is-there-no-na-logical)) |
]

```{r log-na}

# Some examples
### Please follow along

```{r economics}
econ <- economics %>%
	mutate(year = lubridate::year(date))
econ
```

---
# by_year

```{r by_year}
by_year <- split(econ, econ$year)
str(by_year)
```

---
# Fit a simple model to each year
Notes: 
* We'll discuss a more elegant way to do this later

* This is not (statistically) the best way to approach this problem

* It's a good illustration, and in my experience there are lots of times with
this approach works well, even if this particular example is a bit artificial

# What is the relation between personal consumption expenditures (`pce`) and the unemployment percentage?

--
.bolder[Problem:] We don't have the percentage. Let's compute!

### You try first!

---

```{r perc}
perc <- map(by_year, ~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop))
str(perc)
```

---
# Fit the models

Fit a model of the form `lm(percent ~ pce)` to each year

### You try first!

--
```{r many-models}
mods <- map(perc, ~lm(percent ~ pce, data = .x))
str(mods)
```

---
# Extract coefficients

### You try first

Hint: use `coef`. For example, see `coef(mods[[1]])`

--
```{r coefs}
coefs <- map(mods, coef)
coefs[c(1:2, length(coefs))]
```

---
# Extract slopes
AKA - the coefficient that is not the intercept
### You try first

--
```{r slopes}
slopes <- map_dbl(coefs, 2)
slopes
```

---
# Plot

* I trust you can do this

```{r plot-slopes, message = FALSE, fig.height = 4}
relation <- tibble(year = names(slopes),
                   slope = slopes)

ggplot(relation, aes(slope)) +
	geom_histogram(fill = "cornflowerblue",
	               color = "white")
```

---
# Piping
We could also have done the previous in a pipeline. 

```{r pipeline1}
by_year %>%
	map(~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop))
```

---
```{r pipeline2}
by_year %>%
	map(~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop)) %>%
	map(~lm(percent ~ pce, data = .x))
```

---
```{r pipeline3}
by_year %>%
	map(~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop)) %>%
	map(~lm(percent ~ pce, data = .x)) %>%
	map(coef)
```

---
```{r pipeline4}
slopes <- by_year %>%
	map(~mutate(.x, percent = unemploy / pop)) %>%
	map(~lm(percent ~ pce, data = .x)) %>%
	map(coef) %>%
	map_dbl(2)
slopes
```


---
# Practice (if any time remains)
* Compute the standard deviation of every mtcars column.
* Use the following list of formulas to fit multiple models to mtcars

```{r formulas}
 formulas <- list(mpg ~ disp,
                  mpg ~ I(1 / disp),
                  mpg ~ disp + wt,
                  mpg ~ I(1 / disp) + wt) 
``` 
* Copy and run the following code to obtain 50 bootstrap samples

```{r bootstrap}
bootstrap <- function(df) {
  df[sample(nrow(df), replace = TRUE), , drop = FALSE]
}

samples <- map(1:50, ~bootstrap(mtcars))
```

* Fit the following model to each bootstrap sample: `mpg ~ disp`
* Extract $R^2$ and plot the distribution
