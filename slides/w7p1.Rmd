# Take-home midterm review


---
# Purity
A function is pure if

1. Its output depends *only* on its inputs

2. It makes no changes to the state of the world


--
Any behavior that results in a function being impure is referred to as a *side-effect*

---
# Common side effect functions
* We've talked about a few... what are they?

--
### A couple examples
* `print`
* `plot`
* `write.csv`
* `read.csv`
* `Sys.time`
* `options`
* `library`
* `install.packages`

# Conditionals

# Example from lab

3. Write a function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns
the total number of instances where the value is `NA` for both vectors. For
example, given the following two vectors

```{r vects1, eval = FALSE}
c(1, NA, NA, 3, 3, 9, NA)
c(NA, 3, NA, 4, NA, NA, NA)
```

The function should return a value of `2`, because the vectors are both `NA` at
the third and seventh locations. Provide at least one additional test that the function works as expected.

---
# How do you *start* to solve this problem?

--

<span style = "text-decoration: line-through"> 
Start with writing a function
</span>


--
Solve it on a test case, then generalize!


--
### Use the vectors to solve!

```{r vects2}
a <- c(1, NA, NA, 3, 3, 9, NA)
b <- c(NA, 3, NA, 4, NA, NA, NA)
```

---
# One approach

```{r single-case}
is.na(a) 
is.na(b)
is.na(a) & is.na(b)
sum(is.na(a) & is.na(b))
```

---
# Generalize to function

```{r both_na-fun}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

--
### What happens if not same length?

---
# Test it

```{r test-both_na}
both_na(a, b)
both_na(c(a, a), c(b, b))
both_na(a, c(b, b)) # ???
```

--
### What's going on here?

---
# Recycling
* R will *recycle* vectors if they are divisible

```{r recycle1}
data.frame(nums = 1:4,
           lets = c("a", "b"))
```

--
* This will not work if they are not divisible

```{r recycle-fail, error = TRUE}
data.frame(nums = 1:3,
           lets = c("a", "b"))
```

---
# Unexpected results
* In the `both_na` function, recycling can lead to unexpected results, as we saw

* What should we do?

--
* Check that they are the same length, return an error if not

---
# Check lengths
* Stop the evaluation of a function and return an error message with `stop`,
but only if a condition has been met.


--
### Basic structure
```{r error1a, eval = FALSE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(condition) {
		stop("message")
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}

```

---
class: inverse center

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 4, 
                        left = 0, 
                        right = 0,
                        bottom = 1,
                        color_running_background = "#FEE11A",
                        color_running_text = "#000")`
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>



Modify the code below to check that the vectors are of the same length. Return
a .ital[meaningful] error message if not. Test it out!


.left[
```{r error1b, eval = FALSE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(condition) {
		stop("message")
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```
]

---
# Attempt 1
* Did yours look something like this?

```{r error-message1, error = TRUE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		stop("Vectors are of different lengths")
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
both_na(a, b)
both_na(a, c(b, b))
```

---
# More meaningful error message?
### What would make it more meaningful?

--
State the lengths of each
--

```{r error-message2, error = TRUE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		v_lngths <- paste0("x = ", length(x), ", y = ", length(y))
		stop("Vectors are of different lengths:", v_lngths)
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
both_na(a, c(b, b))
```

---
# warnings
If you want to embed a warning, just swap out `stop` for `warning`

---
class: inverse center

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 7, 
                        left = 0, 
                        right = 0,
                        bottom = 1,
                        color_running_background = "#FEE11A",
                        color_running_text = "#000")`
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>


# Challenge
### This is a tricky one
Modify your prior code to so it runs, but returns a warning, if the vectors are
recyclable, and otherwise returns a meaningful error message.

Hint 1: You'll need two conditions

Hint 2: Check if a number is fractional with `%%`, which returns the remainder
in a division problem. So `8 %% 2` and `8 %% 4` both return zero (because
there is no remainder), while and `7 %% 2` returns 1 and `7 %% 4` returns 3.

---
# One approach

```{r error-warn}

both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		lx <- length(x)
		ly <- length(y)
		
		v_lngths <- paste0("x = ", lx, ", y = ", ly)

		if(lx %% ly == 0 | ly %% lx == 0) {
			warning("Vectors were recycled (", v_lngths, ")")
		}
		else {
			stop("Vectors are of different lengths and are not recyclable:",
			     v_lngths)	
		}
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r test-error-warn, warning = TRUE, error = TRUE}
both_na(a, c(b, b))
both_na(a, c(b, b)[-1])
```

# What does this mean operationally?
* Your function should do ONE thing (and do it well)

* Careful when naming functions - be as clear as possible

* Embed useful error messages and warnings
	+ Particularly if you're working on a package or set of functions or others
	are using your functions

* Refactor your code to be more clear after initial drafts (it's okay to be
messy on a first draft)


---
# Example 1
* Anything we can do to clean this up?

```{r clean-up1}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		lx <- length(x)
		ly <- length(y)
		
		v_lngths <- paste0("x = ", lx, ", y = ", ly)

		if(lx %% ly == 0 | ly %% lx == 0) {
			warning("Vectors were recycled (", v_lngths, ")")
		}
		else {
			stop("Vectors are of different lengths and are not recyclable:",
			     v_lngths)	
		}
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}

```

---
# Length calculation

```{r recyclable}
recyclable <- function(x, y) {
	test1 <- length(x) %% length(y)
	test2 <- length(y) %% length(x)

	any(c(test1, test2) == 0)
}
recyclable(a, b)
recyclable(a, c(b, b))
recyclable(a, c(b, b, b))
recyclable(c(a, a), c(b, b, b))
```

---
# Revision

```{r both_na-rev1}
both_na <- function(x, y) {

	if(!recyclable(x, y)) {
		stop("Vectors are of different lengths and are not recyclable: ",
		     "(x = ", length(x),
		     ", y = ", length(y), ")")	
	}

	if(length(x) == length(y)) {
		return(sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y)))
	}
	
	if(recyclable(x, y)) {
		warning("Vectors were recycled (", 
		        "x = ", length(x), 
		        ", y = ", length(y), ")")
		return(sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y)))
	}
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r both_na-rev1-test, error = TRUE, warning = TRUE}
both_na(a, b)
both_na(a, c(b, b))
both_na(c(a, b), c(b, b, b))
both_na(c(a, a), b)
```

---
# Thinking more about return values
* Prior example is the first instance we've seen where there is a possible
return value before the end of the function.

* By default the function will return the last thing that is evaluated

* Override this behavior with `return`

---
# Pop quiz

* What will the following return?

```{r return-nothing}
add_two <- function(x) {
	result <- x + 2
}
```

--
### Answer: Nothing! Why?
```{r add_two-result}
add_two(7)
add_two(5)
```

---
# Specify the return value

The below are all equivalent, and all result in the same function behavior

.pull-left[
```{r add_two}
add_two.1 <- function(x) {
	result <- x + 2
	result
}
add_two.2 <- function(x) {
	x + 2
}
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r add_two.3}
add_two.3 <- function(x) {
	result <- x + 2
	return(result)
}
```
]

---
# When to use `return`?
Generally reserve `return` for you're returning a value prior to the full
evaluation of the function. Otherwise, use `.1` or `.2` methods from prior slide.

---
# Thinking about function names

Which of these is most intuitive?

```{r fun-names}
f <- function(x) {
	x <- sort(x)
	data.frame(value = x, 
	           p = ecdf(x)(x))
}

ptile <- function(x) {
	x <- sort(x)
	data.frame(value = x, 
	           ptile = ecdf(x)(x))
}
percentile_df <- function(x) {
	x <- sort(x)
	data.frame(value = x, 
	           percentile = ecdf(x)(x))
}
```

---
# Output
* The descriptive nature of the output can also help

* Maybe a little too tricky but...

```{r percentile_df}
percentile_df <- function(x) {
	arg <- as.list(match.call())
	x <- sort(x)
	d <- data.frame(value = x, 
	           percentile = ecdf(x)(x))
	
	names(d)[1] <- paste0(as.character(arg$x), collapse = "_")
	d
}
random_vector <- rnorm(100)
tail(percentile_df(random_vector))
head(percentile_df(rnorm(50)))
```

---
# Thinking about dependencies
* What's the purpose of the function?

	+ Just your use? Never needed again? Don't worry about it at all.

	+ Mass scale? Worry a fair bit, but make informed decisions.

* What's the likelihood of needing to reproduce the results in the future?

	+ If high, worry more.

* Consider using name spacing (`::`)

# Non-standard evaluation (NSE)
### A high-level look

---
# Note
* Were it not for the tidyverse, I would not even mention NSE

* Generally, it's not an incredibly important topic

* But, NSE is ubiquitous in the tidyverse - literally just about everything uses
NSE, which makes programming with tidyverse functions more difficult


---
# What is NSE
* Implementation of different scoping rules

* In dplyr and many others, arguments are evaluated inside the specified data
frames, rather than the current or global environment.


--
### How?
(a) Capture an expression (quote it)
(b) Use the expression within the correct context (evaluate it)

So, `x` is evaluated as, e.g., `df$x` rather than `globalenv()$x`. 


---
# Could be applied with our previous example!
* Here `base::substitute`

```{r nse-percentile_df}
percentile_df <- function(x) {
	sorted <- sort(x)
	d <- data.frame(sorted, percentile = ecdf(sorted)(sorted))
	names(d)[1] <- paste0(substitute(x), collapse = "_")
	d
}
percentile_df(rnorm(100, 5, 0.2)) %>%
	head()
```

---
# Why is NSE used so frequently in the tidyverse?

.pull-left[
```{r add_var}
select(mpg, 
       manufacturer, model, hwy)
```
]

.pull-right[
* It makes interactive work easier!

* But programming is a harder...

* Without NSE, `select` and similar functions would not know where `manufacturer`, `model`, or `hwy` "live". It would be looking for objects in the global environment with these names.
]

---
# dplyr programming fail

* Let's say we wanted a function that returned means in a nice table-y format
for a variable by two groups (e.g., cross-tab sort of format)


--
* Typically, we would start by solving this problem for a single situation, then
we'd generalize it to a function.


--
* Let's do it!


---
```{r group-means-practice}
mtcars %>%
	group_by(cyl, gear) %>%
	summarize(mean = mean(mpg, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
	spread(cyl, mean)
```


---
# Generalize to a function

Typically, we would expect something like this to work

```{r }
group_means <- function(data, outcome, group_1, group_2) {
	data %>%
		group_by(group_1, group_2) %>%
		summarize(mean = mean(outcome, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
		spread(group_1, mean)
}
```

---
# But it doesn't...

```{r group_means-fail, error = TRUE}
group_means(mtcars, mpg, cyl, gear)
group_means(diamonds, price, cut, clarity)
```

--
### Why?
* It's looking for an object called `group_1` that doesn't exist inside the function or in the global workspace!


--
### Solution
* Quote it, and evaluate it in the correct place

---
# The {rlang} version

```{r rlang}
group_means <- function(data, outcome, group_1, group_2) {
	out <- enquo(outcome) # Quote the inputs
	g1 <- enquo(group_1)
	g2 <- enquo(group_2)

	data %>%
		group_by(!!g1, !!g2) %>% # !! to evaluate (bang-bang)
		summarize(mean = mean(!!out, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
		spread(!!g1, mean)
}
```

---

```{r group_means-success}
group_means(mtcars, mpg, cyl, gear)
group_means(diamonds, price, cut, clarity)
```


---
# Alternative: Pass the dots!
* Note, I've made the function a bit simpler here by removing the spread

```{r pass-dots}
group_means2 <- function(data, outcome, ...) {
	out <- enquo(outcome) # Still have to quote the outcome

	data %>%
		group_by(...) %>% 
		summarize(mean = mean(!!out, na.rm = TRUE)) 
}

group_means2(mtcars, mpg, cyl, gear)
group_means2(diamonds, price, cut, clarity)
```


---
# Added benefit
I can now also pass as many columns as I want, and it will still work!

```{r pass-dots2}
group_means2(diamonds, price, cut, clarity, color)
```

---
# Example with plotting
* ggplot, for now, has a few tools to make programming with it easier

* These have all been soft deprecated, in favor of {rlang}

* But overall we have the same basic problem

---
# Does not work
```{r scatter-fun-fail, error = TRUE}
check_linear <- function(data, x, y, se = TRUE) {
	p <- ggplot(data, aes(x, y)) +

  if(se) {
  	p <- p +
  				geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  				geom_smooth() 
  }
  else {

  				geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  				geom_smooth(se = FALSE)	
  }
  p
}
check_linear(mtcars, disp, mpg)
```

---
# Use `aes_string`
### Soft deprecated
(notice dots being passed now too)

```{r scatter-fun-success1, fig.height = 4}
check_linear <- function(data, x, y, ...) {
	ggplot(data, aes_string(x, y)) +
	  geom_point(color = "gray80") +
		geom_smooth(method = "lm",
		            color = "magenta", 
			          ...) +
		geom_smooth(...)
}
```

---
```{r scatter-fun1}
check_linear(mtcars, "disp", "mpg")
```

---
# Use `aes_` with `as.name`
### Soft deprecated

```{r scatter-fun-success2}
check_linear <- function(data, x, y, ...) {
	ggplot(data, aes_(as.name(x), as.name(y))) +
	  geom_point(color = "gray80") +
		geom_smooth(method = "lm",
		            color = "magenta", 
			          ...) +
		geom_smooth(...)
}
```

---
```{r scatter-fun2}
check_linear(mtcars, "disp", "mpg")
```

---
# Passing dots
```{r scatter-dots}
check_linear(mtcars, "disp", "mpg", se = FALSE)
```

---
# Use tidyeval
### Method to use going forward

```{r scatter-fun-success3}
check_linear <- function(data, x, y, ...) {
	xvar <- enquo(x)
	yvar <- enquo(y)

	ggplot(data, aes(!!xvar, !!yvar)) +
	  geom_point(color = "gray80") +
		geom_smooth(method = "lm",
		            color = "magenta", 
			          ...) +
		geom_smooth(...)
}
```

---

```{r scatter-tidyeval}
check_linear(mtcars, disp, mpg)
```


---
# Add ggplot functions
```{r ggplot-extend, fig.height = 5}
check_linear(mtcars, disp, mpg, se = FALSE) +
	labs(title = "Checking linearity",
	     subtitle = "Linear vs LOESS fits",
	     x = "Engine Displacement",
	     y = "Miles Per gallon") +
	theme_dark(20)

```

---
# Overall takeaway
* Programming with the tidyverse is a bit more difficult

* Also introduces dependencies

* Doesn't mean it's not worth it, if the context fits.
	+ If you're plotting, I think `ggplot` is worth it

### Pretty sure we won't have time...
But here's another example of iterating through multiple drafts of a function.


---
# Example 2
* Standardized mean difference between two groups: Cohen's $d$

$$
 d = \frac { \overline { X } \_ { 1 } - \overline { X } \_ { 2 } } { \sqrt { \frac { ( n \_ { 1 } - 1 ) SD \_ { 1 } ^ { 2 } + ( n \_ { 2 } - 1 ) SD \_ { 2 } ^ { 2 } } { n \_ { 1 } + n \_ { 2 } - 2 } } } 
$$

# First draft

```{r coh_d1}
coh_d <- function(x1, x2, na.rm = TRUE) {
	m1 <- mean(x1, na.rm = na.rm)
	m2 <- mean(x2, na.rm = na.rm)
	var1 <- var(x1, na.rm = na.rm)
	var2 <- var(x2, na.rm = na.rm)

	if(na.rm == TRUE) {
		n1 <- length(na.omit(x1))
		n2 <- length(na.omit(x2))
	} else {
		n1 <- length(x1)
		n2 <- length(x2)
	}
	
	(m1 - m2) /
	  (sqrt(
	    ((n1 - 1)*var1 + (n2 - 1)*var2) /
	      (n1 + n2 -2)
	    )
	  )
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r test-coh_d}
set.seed(42)
coh_d(rnorm(1000, 100, 1), rnorm(1000, 95, 1))
```

--
### What can we do to improve it?

--
* Split it into at least two functions - `mean_diff` and `pooled_sd`

---
```{r mean_diff}
mean_diff <- function(x1, x2, na.rm = TRUE) {
	m1 <- mean(x1, na.rm = na.rm)
	m2 <- mean(x2, na.rm = na.rm)

	m1 - m2
}

pooled_sd <- function(x1, x2, na.rm = TRUE) {
	var1 <- var(x1, na.rm = na.rm)
	var2 <- var(x2, na.rm = na.rm)

	if(na.rm == TRUE) {
		n1 <- length(na.omit(x1))
		n2 <- length(na.omit(x2))
	} else {
		n1 <- length(x1)
		n2 <- length(x2)
	}
	
	((n1 - 1)*var1 + (n2 - 1)*var2) / (n1 + n2 -2)
}

```

---
# Draft 2

```{r coh_d2}
coh_d <- function(x1, x2, na.rm = TRUE) {
	mean_diff(x1, x2, na.rm = na.rm) /
	  pooled_sd(x1, x2, na.rm = na.rm)
}
coh_d(rnorm(1000, 100, 1), rnorm(1000, 95, 1))
```

---
# Anything else we could do?

--
* Pull `n` and `var` calculations out from `pooled_sd`


--
```{r ns-vars}
ns <- function(x1, x2, na.rm = TRUE) {
	if(na.rm == TRUE) {
		n1 <- length(na.omit(x1))
		n2 <- length(na.omit(x2))
	} else {
