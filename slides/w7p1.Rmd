# Agenda
* Review take-home midterm

* Purity (quickly)

* Function conditional
	+ `if (condition) {}`
	+ embedding warnings, messages, and errors

---
# Learning objectives
* Understand the concept of purity, and why it is often desirable
	+ And be able to define a side effect

* Be able to change the behavior of a function based on the input

* Be able to embed warnings/messages/errors

# Take-home midterm review


---
# Purity
A function is pure if

1. Its output depends *only* on its inputs

2. It makes no changes to the state of the world


--
Any behavior that results in a function being impure is referred to as a *side-effect*

---
# Common side effect functions
* We've talked about a few... what are they?

--
### A couple examples
* `print`
* `plot`
* `write.csv`
* `read.csv`
* `Sys.time`
* `options`
* `library`
* `install.packages`

# Example from lab

3. Write a function that takes two vectors of the same length and returns
the total number of instances where the value is `NA` for both vectors. For
example, given the following two vectors

```{r vects1, eval = FALSE}
c(1, NA, NA, 3, 3, 9, NA)
c(NA, 3, NA, 4, NA, NA, NA)
```

The function should return a value of `2`, because the vectors are both `NA` at
the third and seventh locations. Provide at least one additional test that the function works as expected.

---
# How do you *start* to solve this problem?

--

<span style = "text-decoration: line-through"> 
Start with writing a function
</span>


--
Solve it on a test case, then generalize!


--
### Use the vectors to solve!

```{r vects2}
a <- c(1, NA, NA, 3, 3, 9, NA)
b <- c(NA, 3, NA, 4, NA, NA, NA)
```

---
# One approach

```{r single-case}
is.na(a) 
is.na(b)
is.na(a) & is.na(b)
sum(is.na(a) & is.na(b))
```

---
# Generalize to function

```{r both_na-fun}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

--
### What happens if not same length?

---
# Test it

```{r test-both_na}
both_na(a, b)
both_na(c(a, a), c(b, b))
both_na(a, c(b, b)) # ???
```

--
### What's going on here?

---
# Recycling
* R will *recycle* vectors if they are divisible

```{r recycle1}
data.frame(nums = 1:4,
           lets = c("a", "b"))
```

--
* This will not work if they are not divisible

```{r recycle-fail, error = TRUE}
data.frame(nums = 1:3,
           lets = c("a", "b"))
```

---
# Unexpected results
* In the `both_na` function, recycling can lead to unexpected results, as we saw

* What should we do?

--
* Check that they are the same length, return an error if not

---
# Check lengths
* Stop the evaluation of a function and return an error message with `stop`,
but only if a condition has been met.


--
### Basic structure
```{r error1a, eval = FALSE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(condition) {
		stop("message")
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}

```

---
class: inverse center

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 4, 
                        left = 0, 
                        right = 0,
                        bottom = 1,
                        color_running_background = "#FEE11A",
                        color_running_text = "#000")`
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>



Modify the code below to check that the vectors are of the same length. Return
a .ital[meaningful] error message if not. Test it out!


.left[
```{r error1b, eval = FALSE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(condition) {
		stop("message")
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```
]

---
# Attempt 1
* Did yours look something like this?

```{r error-message1, error = TRUE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		stop("Vectors are of different lengths")
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
both_na(a, b)
both_na(a, c(b, b))
```

---
# More meaningful error message?
### What would make it more meaningful?

--
State the lengths of each
--

```{r error-message2, error = TRUE}
both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		v_lngths <- paste0("x = ", length(x), ", y = ", length(y))
		stop("Vectors are of different lengths:", v_lngths)
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
both_na(a, c(b, b))
```

---
# warnings
If you want to embed a warning, just swap out `stop` for `warning`

---
class: inverse center

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 7, 
                        left = 0, 
                        right = 0,
                        bottom = 1,
                        color_running_background = "#FEE11A",
                        color_running_text = "#000")`

# Challenge
### This is a tricky one
Modify your prior code to so it runs, but returns a warning, if the vectors are
recyclable, and otherwise returns a meaningful error message.

Hint 1: You'll need two conditions

Hint 2: Check if a number is fractional with `%%`, which returns the remainder
in a division problem. So `8 %% 2` and `8 %% 4` both return zero (because
there is no remainder), while and `7 %% 2` returns 1 and `7 %% 4` returns 3.

---
# One approach

```{r error-warn}

both_na <- function(x, y) {
	if(length(x) != length(y)) {
		lx <- length(x)
		ly <- length(y)
		
		v_lngths <- paste0("x = ", lx, ", y = ", ly)

		if(lx %% ly == 0 | ly %% lx == 0) {
			warning("Vectors were recycled (", v_lngths, ")")
		}
		else {
			stop("Vectors are of different lengths and are not recyclable:",
			     v_lngths)	
		}
	}
	sum(is.na(x) & is.na(y))
}
```

---
# Test it

```{r test-error-warn, warning = TRUE, error = TRUE}
both_na(a, c(b, b))
both_na(a, c(b, b)[-1])
```

# How important is this?

* For most of the work you do? Not very

* Develop a package? Very!

* Develop functions that others use, even if not through a function? Sort of.

---
# Next time
* Non-standard evaluation

* Building up functions

* Thinking more about messages/warnings/erros
