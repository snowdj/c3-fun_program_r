# Agenda
* Finish up slides from Wednesday

* Discuss `map2_*` and `pmap_*`

* Introduce `walk`, `reduce` and `safely`

---
# Learning objectives
* Understand the differences between `map`, `map2`, and `pmap`

* Know when to apply `walk` instead of `map`, and why it may be useful

* Be able to collapse lists with `reduce`

* Diagnose errors with `safely` (and understand other situations where it may
be helpful)

# A few Examples
Basic simulations - iterating over two vectors

Plots by month, changing the title

---
# Simulation
* Simulate data from a normal distribution
	+ Vary $n$ from 5 to 150 by increments of 5
	+ For each $n$, vary $mu$ from -2 to 2 by increments of 0.25


--
### How do we get all combinations

--
`expand.grid`

---
# Example `expand.grid`
### Bonus: It turns it into a data frame!
```{r expand.grid}
ints <- 1:3
lets <- c("a", "b", "c")
expand.grid(ints, lets)
```

---
# Set conditions

```{r sim-conditions}
conditions <- expand.grid(n = seq(5, 150, 5),
                          mu = seq(-2, 2, 0.25))
head(conditions)
tail(conditions)
```

---
# Simulate!

```{r sim1}
sim1 <- map2(conditions$n, conditions$mu, ~rnorm(.x, .y, sd = 10))
str(sim1)
```

---
# More powerful
### Add it as a list column!

```{r list-column-sim1}
sim2 <- conditions %>%
	as_tibble() %>% # Not required, but definitely helpful
	mutate(sim = map2(n, mu, ~rnorm(.x, .y, sd = 10))) 
sim2
```

---
# Unnest

```{r list-column-sim2}
conditions %>%
	as_tibble() %>% # Not required, but definitely helpful
	mutate(sim = map2(n, mu, ~rnorm(.x, .y, sd = 10))) %>%
	unnest()
```

---
class: inverse center middle
# What if we wanted to vary the sd too?

--
### `pmap`
Which we'll get to soon

---
# Varying the title of a plot
### The data
```{r pulitzer-data}
library(fivethirtyeight)
pulitzer
```

---
# Prep data

```{r pulitzer-prep}
pulitzer <- pulitzer %>%
	select(newspaper, starts_with("num")) %>%
	gather(year_range, n, -newspaper) %>%
	mutate(year_range = str_replace_all(year_range, "num_finals", ""),
	       year_range = str_replace_all(year_range, "_", "-")) %>%
	filter(year_range != "1990-2014")
pulitzer
```

---
# One plot

```{r one-plot-pulitzer, fig.height = 3.25}
pulitzer %>%
	filter(newspaper == "Wall Street Journal") %>%
ggplot(aes(year_range, n)) +
	geom_col(aes(fill = n)) +
	scale_fill_distiller(type = "seq", 
	                     limits = c(0, max(pulitzer$n)),
	                     palette = "BuPu",
	                     direction = 1) +
	ylim(0, max(pulitzer$n)) +
	coord_flip() +
	labs(title = "Pulitzer Prize winners: Wall Street Journal",
	     x = "Year Range") 
```


---
# Nest data

```{r pulitzer-nested}
pulitzer %>%
	group_by(newspaper) %>%
	nest()
```


---
# Produce all plots
### You try first!
Don't worry about the correct title yet, if you don't want

--
```{r pulitzer-plots1}
pulitzer %>%
	group_by(newspaper) %>%
	nest() %>%
	mutate(plot = map(data, ~ggplot(.x, aes(year_range, n)) +

		scale_fill_distiller(type = "seq", 
		                     limits = c(0, max(pulitzer$n)),
		                     palette = "BuPu",
		                     direction = 1) +
	  ylim(0, max(pulitzer$n)) +
	  coord_flip() +
		labs(title = "Pulitzer Prize winners")))
```


---
# Add title

```{r pulitzer-plots2}
library(glue)

p <- pulitzer %>%
	group_by(newspaper) %>%
	nest() %>%
	mutate(plot = map2(data, newspaper, ~
	  ggplot(.x, aes(year_range, n)) +
		  geom_col(aes(fill = n)) +
		  scale_fill_distiller(type = "seq", 
		                       limits = c(0, max(pulitzer$n)),
		                       palette = "BuPu",
		                       direction = 1) +
	    ylim(0, max(pulitzer$n)) +
	    coord_flip() +
		  labs(title = glue("Pulitzer Prize winners: {.y}"))))

# Save all plots

We'll have to iterate across at least two things: (a) file path/names, and (b)
the plots themselves


---
#`walk`

* Why `walk` for saving instead of `map`?

> Walk is an alternative to map that you use when you want to call a function for its side effects, rather than for its return value. You typically do this because you want to render output to the screen or save files to disk - the important thing is the action, not the return value.

\-[r4ds](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#walk)

---
# Example

### Create a directory
```{r create_dir}
fs::dir_create(here::here("plots", "pulitzers"))
```

--
### Create file paths
```{r create_file-paths}
files <- str_replace_all(tolower(final_plots$newspaper), " ", "-")
paths <- here::here("plots", "pulitzers", glue("{files}.png"))
paths
```

---
# Save plots

```{r walk2, eval = FALSE}
walk2(paths, final_plots$plots, ggsave,
      width = 9.5, 
      height = 6.5,
      dpi = 500)
```

---
# Wrap-up
* Lots more to `{purrr}` we weren't able to get to
  + May be interested in `safely`,`reduce`, `modify`, and `pull` and `pluck`
  
* Function programming can *really* help your efficiency, and even if it slows you down initially, I'd recommend striving toward it, because it will ultimately be a huge help.
