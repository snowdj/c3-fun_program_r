# Learning objects for this class

--
* Understand and be able to describe the differences in R's data structures and when each is most appropriate for a given task


--
* Explore `purrr::map` and its variants, how they relate to base R functions, and why the {purrr} variants are often preferable.


--
* Work with lists and list columns using `purrr::nest` and `purrr:unnest`


--
* Fit multiple (basic) models using the [{broom}](https://broom.tidyverse.org) package with {purrr} 


--
* Convert repetitive tasks into functions 


--
* Understand elements of good functions, and things to avoid


--
* Write effective and clear functions to continue with the mantra of "Don't Repeat Yourself"

---
# This Week's learning objectives

* Understand the requirements of the course

* Understand the requirements of the final project

# What is it?
### Two basic options

--

# Data Product 
Similar to first class

* Brief research manuscript (can be APA or not, I don't really care ü§∑)
* Shiny app
* Dashboard
  + Probably unlikely to work well though, unless you make it a shiny dashboard
* Blog post
* For the ambitious - a documented R package

---
# Tutorial
* Probably best done through a blog post or series of blog posts
* Approach as if you're teaching others about the content I'll ask you to cover
* BONUS: You can actually release the blog post(s) and may get some traffic üéâüëèü•≥

# Make it your own


---
# What you have to have
* Everything on GitHub

* Publicly available dataset

* Team of 2-4

---
# What you have to cover
Unfortunately, this still is a class assignment. I have to be able to evaluate
that you can actually apply the content within a messy, real-world setting.


--
The grading criteria (which follow) may force you into some use cases that are 
a bit artificial. This is okay.


---
# Grading criteria

* No code is used repetitively (no more than twice) .blue[10 points]


--
* More than one variant of `purrr::map` is used .blue[10 points]


--
* At least one {purrr} function outside the basic `map` family (`walk_*`, 
  `reduce`, `modify_*`, etc.) .blue[10 points]


--
* At least one instance of parallel iteration (e.g., `map2_*`, `pmap_*`) .blue[10
points]


--
* At least one use case of `purrr::nest %&gt;% mutate()` .blue[10 points]


---
* At least two custom functions .blue[20 points; 10 points each]
  + Each function must be "pure" unless it is clear that it should have side 
    effects (e.g., a plotting function)
  + Each function must do exactly one thing
  + The functions **may** replicate the behavior of a base function - as noted 
    above this is about practicing the skills you learn in class


--
* Code is fully reproducible and housed on GitHub .blue[10 points]


--
* No obvious errors in chosen output format .blue[10 points]


--
* Deployed on the web and shareable through a link .blue[10 points]


---
# Outline
### Due 5/1/19

Four components:
* Description of data source (must be publicly available)

* Purpose (tutorial or substantive)

* Chosen format

* Lingering questions
  + How can I help?


--
Please include all components - including the question(s) section!

---
# Draft
### Due 5/27/19, before class
* Expected to still be a work in progress

  + This means some of your code may be rough and/or incomplete. However:

* Direction should be obvious

* Most, if not all, grading elements should be present

* Provided to your peers so they can learn from you as much as you can learn 
  from their feedback

---
# Peer Review
* Exact same process we've used before

* It has always gone very well - let's keep it going

* If, during your peer review, you find grading elements  not present,
definitely note them

---
# Utilizing GitHub (required)
* You'll be assigned two groups to review (10 points each)

* Fork their repo

* Embed comments, suggest changes to their code

* Submit a PR
  
  + Summarize your overall review in the PR

* I WILL cover this this term, barring a tornado or similar

---
# Grading
250 points total

* 4 labs at 10 points each (40 points; 16%) 

* 1 DataCamp modules (10 points; 4%) 

* Midterm (50 points; 20%)

* Final Project (150 points; 60%)

  + Proposal (10 points; 4%)

  + Draft (20 points; 8%)

  + Peer review (20 points; 8%)

  + Product (100 points; 40%)

# Missing class

I will be out Monday next week

# Any time left?

# Basic data types

---
# Vectors
### Pop quiz
Discuss with your neighbor
* What are the four basic types of atomic vectors?

* What function creates a vector?

* T/F: A list (an R list) is not a vector.

* What is the fundamental difference between a matrix and a data frame?

* What does *coercion* mean, and when does it come into play?

---
# Vector types
### 4 basic types
Note there are two others (complex and raw), but we don't care about them (I've
never even seen them used).

* Integer

* Double

* Logical

* Character


--
Integer and double vectors are both numeric.

---
# Creating vectors

Vectors are created with `c`. Below are examples of each of the four main types
of vectors.


```r
integer &lt;- c(5L, 7L, 3L, 94L) # L explicitly an integer, not double
double &lt;- c(3.27, 8.41)
logical &lt;- c(TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
character &lt;- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "violet", "rainbow")
```

---
# Coercion
* Vectors **must** be of the same type. 

* If you try to mix types, implicit coercion will occur

* Implicit coercion defaults to the most flexible type
  + which is... ?

--


```r
c(7L, 3.25)
```

```
## [1] 7.00 3.25
```

```r
c(3.24, TRUE, "April")
```

```
## [1] "3.24"  "TRUE"  "April"
```

```r
c(TRUE, 5)
```

```
## [1] 1 5
```

---
# Explicit coercion
* You can alternatively define the coercion to occur


```r
as.integer(c(7L, 3.25))
```

```
## [1] 7 3
```

```r
as.logical(c(3.24, TRUE, "April"))
```

```
## [1]   NA TRUE   NA
```

```r
as.character(c(TRUE, 5))
```

```
## [1] "1" "5"
```

---
# Checking types

* Use `typeof` to verify the type of vector


```r
typeof(c(7L, 3.25))
```

```
## [1] "double"
```

```r
typeof(as.integer(c(7L, 3.25)))
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

---
# Piping
* Although traditionally used within the tidyverse (not what we're doing here),
it can still be useful. The following are equivalent


```r
library(magrittr)

typeof(as.integer(c(7L, 3.25)))
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

```r
c(7L, 3.25) %&gt;%
  as.integer() %&gt;%
  typeof()
```

```
## [1] "integer"
```

---
# Next time
* More on data types
* Subsetting
* Lists
* More on coercion
