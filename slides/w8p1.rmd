### It's required you make this joke when talking about shiny
(especially if you're a parent of a 5 and 7 year old)

---
# The basics!
Do the following:
* Create a new R project
* Select "Shiny Web Application"
* Select the directory
* Click "create project"

[demo]

---
# First thing - Run App!
* I like to open in the browser

* What's going on here? Talk with your neighbor and see if you can deduce the
basic functionality.

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 2, 
                        left = 0, 
                        right = 0,
                        bottom = 0.5,
                        color_running_background = "#FEE11A",
                        color_running_text = "#000")`


---
# UI 

* The `ui` defines the look and feel of the app - the user interface

* Use it to define where output "lives"

* It also defines the inputs for the `server`, where functions are actually
evaluated.

* In this case - we have defined a `sliderInput`, which we're calling `"bins"`.
It will take on values from 1 to 50, and will start at 30.

* Access the specific value the user selects within the `server`, through `input$bins`.


---
# Server

* The `server` function takes the input from the UI and puts it in normal R code.

* In this case, we're creating one output object, called `distPlot`. The result is then called through the `ui` on line 30

* Try removing lines 39-44, and replacing it with `print(input$bins)`


--
* Feels like it should work, but it doesn't. Any ideas why?


--
* We are no longer rendering a plot. We are rendering text. We need to change `renderPlot` to `renderText` and `plotOutput` to `textOutput`. 

Does it work now?


---
# Challenge
* Try producing essentially the same thing as the default, but use `ggplot` instead of base plotting.

* Reminder, the data are called `faithful`, and you'll be showing the distribution of `waiting`

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 10, 
                        left = 0, 
                        right = 0,
                        bottom = 0.5,
                        color_running_background = "#FEE11A",
                        color_running_text = "#000")`

---
class: inverse center middle
# [demo]

---
# Change the input
* Let's say instead of a slider, we want 5 options: 1, 5, 20, 50, or 100


--
* We can change the input from a slider (representing continuous intervals) to radio buttons, representing discrete choices.


--
* Just change `sliderInput` to `radioButtons`, and put in the appropriate `choices`. You can also add a `selected` argument for which it defaults to.


--
* Tricky - it will treat the input from `radioButtons` as a character/factor, so you have to override this behavior.


--
### Try it out!

`r countdown::countdown(minutes = 5, 
                        left = 0, 
                        right = 0,
                        bottom = 1,
                        color_running_background = "#FEE11A",
                        color_running_text = "#000")`

---
class: inverse center middle
# [demo]

---
# More complicated
* Let's say we wanted to build a plot that showed the distribution of highway miles per gallon that could be faceted by `year`, `trans`, or `class`.

* Let's say you also wanted to keep a slider on there to control the number of bins.

* Use `radioButtons` for the variables, and `sliderInput` for the bins.

* You'll need to create a second entry to your `ui`


[demo]


---
# Tables

* My recommendation - use the `DT` package, with `DT::datatable`.


--
* Sort of silly example - let's build a table to go below our distribution(s) that shows `mean`, `sd`, `min`, and `max` of the corresponding distribution(s)


--
* You'll need to create a new output object in the server, and tell the ui where it should be rendered


--
* Use `renderDataTable` in the server and `dataTableOutput` in the ui


--
* If you want to use `{dplyr}`, as I would, then you have to deal with NSE. In this case it's not that big of a deal though. Just use `!!sym(input$var)`, where `sym` transforms a string to a symbol.


[demo]

---
# Last thing for today
### Change the layout

* Let's say instead of having the table below, we wanted it within a tabset


--
* Just create a `tabsetPanel` within the `mainPanel`, then put the output for each tab within `tabPanel`.

--
[demo]


---
# Alternative

* Instead of using a tabset with `tabsetPanel`, you might want to have a navbar at the top of the page, which you can create with `navbarPage`.


--
* Can be a bit more complicated - each `tabset` needs to include everything, including the `sidebarPanel` (if present), could include tabsets, `mainPanel`, etc.


--
* Essentially each tab from the `navbar` becomes an entirely new page.


--
* Consider pulling pieces out as a refactoring method to try to make code more readable/less buggy.

# Conclusions
* Shiny is super customizable - just scratched the surface today

* Great for building interactive plots, but you can use it for all sorts of other things too (including text and tables)

* Next time we'll talk about {shinydashboard} for, basically, an alternative layout.

* If you end up wanting to go deep with shiny, you may want to read more about [reactivity](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/understanding-reactivity.html)
