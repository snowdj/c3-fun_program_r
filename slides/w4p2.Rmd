# Agenda
* Finish up last few slides from Monday

* Review Lab 2

* Introduce list columns

* In-class midterm (last 20 minutes)

---
# Learning objectives
* Understand list columns and how they relate to `base::split`

* Fluently nest/unnest data frames

* Understand why `tidyr::nest` can be a powerful framework (data frames) and
when `tidyr::unnest` can/should be used to move out of nested data frames and
into a standard data frame.

# Setup
Let's first get the data we want

(please follow along)

.left[
```{r import-data}
library(tidyverse)
library(fs)
files <- dir_ls(here::here("data"), glob = "*.csv")
d <- files %>%
	map_df(read_csv, .id = "file") %>%
	mutate(file = str_replace_all(file, here::here("data"), ""),
	       grade = str_replace_all(file, 
	                               "/g(\\d?\\d).+", "\\1"),
	       grade = as.integer(grade),
	       year = str_replace_all(file, 
	                              ".+files(\\d\\d)_sim.+", 
	                              "\\1"),
	       year = as.integer(year),
	       content = str_replace_all(file, 
	                                 "/g\\d?\\d(.+)pfiles.+", 
	                                 "\\1")) %>%
	select(-file) %>%
	select(ssid, grade, year, content, testeventid, asmtprmrydsbltycd,
	       asmtscndrydsbltycd, Entry:WMLE)
```
]

---
# Comparing models
Let's say we wanted to fit/compare a set of models for each content area

1. `lm(Theta ~ asmtprmrydsbltycd)`

1. `lm(Theta ~ asmtprmrydsbltycd + asmtscndrydsbltycd)`

1. `lm(Theta ~ asmtprmrydsbltycd + asmtscndrydsbltycd +
	asmtprmrydsbltycd:asmtscndrydsbltycd)`

---
# Data pre-processing
* The disability variables are stored as numbers, we need them as factors
* We'll make the names easier in the process

```{r disab-recode}
d <- d %>%
	mutate(primary = as.factor(asmtprmrydsbltycd),
	       secondary = as.factor(asmtscndrydsbltycd))
```

If you're interested in what the specific codes refer to, see [here](https://www.newberg.k12.or.us/district/eligibility-codes-and-requirements).

---
# Split the data

The base method we've been using...

```{r split}
splt_content <- split(d, d$content)
str(splt_content)
```

---
# We could use this method

```{r fit-models-split}
m1 <- map(splt_content, ~lm(Theta ~ asmtprmrydsbltycd, data = .x))

m2 <- map(splt_content, ~lm(Theta ~ asmtprmrydsbltycd + 
                                    asmtscndrydsbltycd, 
                            data = .x))

m3 <- map(splt_content, ~lm(Theta ~ asmtprmrydsbltycd *
                                    asmtscndrydsbltycd, 
                            data = .x))
```

* We could then go through and conduct tests to see which model was better, etc.


---
# Alternative
* Create a data frame with a list column

```{r list-column}
by_content <- d %>%
	nest(-content)
by_content
```

---
# What's going on here?

```{r list-column-listed}
str(by_content$data)
```

---
# Explore a bit

```{r map-data1}
map_dbl(by_content$data, nrow)
map_dbl(by_content$data, ncol)
map_dbl(by_content$data, ~mean(.x$Theta))
```

---
# It's a data frame!

We can add these summaries if we want

```{r n-by-content}
by_content %>%
	mutate(n = map_dbl(data, nrow))
```

---
# `map_*`
* Note on the previous example we used `map_dbl` and we got a vector in return. 

* What would happen if we just used `map`?

--

```{r n-by-content-list}
by_content %>%
	mutate(n = map(data, nrow))
```

---
# Let's fit a model!

```{r list-column-model}
by_content %>%
	mutate(m1 = map(data, ~lm(Theta ~ primary, data = .x)))
```

---
# Extract the coefficients

```{r }
by_content %>%
	mutate(m1 = map(data, ~lm(Theta ~ primary, data = .x)),
         coefs = map(m1, coef))
```

---
# Challenge

* Continue with the above, but output a data frame with three columns:
`content`, `intercept`, and `TBI` (which is code 74). 

* In other words, output the
mean score for students who were coded as not having a disability (code 0),
along with students coded as having TBI.

---

```{r coefs}
by_content %>%
	mutate(m1 = map(data, ~lm(Theta ~ primary, data = .x)),
	       coefs = map(m1, coef), 
	       no_disab = map_dbl(coefs, 1),
	       tbi = no_disab + map_dbl(coefs, "primary74")) %>%
	select(content, no_disab, tbi)
```

---
# Compare models
* Back to our original task - fit all three models

### You try first

1. `lm(Theta ~ primary)`

1. `lm(Theta ~ primary + secondary)`

1. `lm(Theta ~ primary + secondary + primary:secondary)`


---
# Model fits

```{r three-mods}
mods <- by_content %>%
	mutate(m1 = map(data, ~lm(Theta ~ primary, data = .x)),
         m2 = map(data, ~lm(Theta ~ primary + secondary, data = .x)),
         m3 = map(data, ~lm(Theta ~ primary * secondary, data = .x)))
mods
```

---
# Brief foray into parallel iterations
The `stats::anova` function can compare the fit of two models

--
### Pop Quiz

How would we extract just ELA model 1 and 2?

--

.pull-left[
```{r ela-mods1}
mods$m1[[1]]
```
]

.pull-right[
```{r ela-mods2}
mods$m2[[1]]
```
]

---
# Which fits better?

```{r anova}
compare <- anova(mods$m1[[1]], mods$m2[[1]])
compare
```

---
# `map2`

* Works the same as `map` but iterates over two vectors concurrently

* Let's compare model 1 and 2

--
```{r mod_compare1}
mods %>%
	mutate(comp12 = map2(m1, m2, anova))
```

--
Perhaps not terrifically helpful


---
# Back to our `anova` object
* Can we pull out  useful things?

```{r str-comp}
str(compare)
```

--
Try pulling out the $p$ value

---
# Extract $p$ value
* *Note - I'd recommend looking at more than just a p-value, but I do think this
is useful for a quick glance*

```{r extract-p1}
compare$`Pr(>F)`
compare[["Pr(>F)"]]
```

--

```{r extract-p2}
compare$`Pr(>F)`[2]
compare[["Pr(>F)"]][2]
```

---
# All p-values

*Note - this is probably the most compact syntax, but that doesn't mean it's the
most clear*

```{r pull-pvals12}
mods %>%
	mutate(comp12 = map2(m1, m2, anova),
	       p12 = map_dbl(comp12, list("Pr(>F)", 2)))
```

---
# Slight alternative
* Write a function that pulls the p-value from model comparison objects

```{r fun-compare}
extract_p <- function(anova_ob) {
	anova_ob[["Pr(>F)"]][2]
}
```


--
* Loop this function through the anova objects

---
```{r pull-pvals12-fun}
mods %>%
	mutate(comp12 = map2(m1, m2, anova),
	       p12 = map_dbl(comp12, extract_p))
```

---
# Look at all $R^2$
### It's a normal data frame!

```{r gather-models}
mods %>%
	gather(model, output, m1:m3)
```

---
# Extract all $R^2$

*Note - might want to write a function here again*

```{r extract-r2}
mods %>%
	gather(model, output, m1:m3) %>%
	mutate(r2 = map_dbl(output, ~summary(.x)$r.squared))
```

---
# Plot

```{r model-plot, fig.height = 4.5}
mods %>%
	gather(model, output, m1:m3) %>%
	mutate(r2 = map_dbl(output, ~summary(.x)$r.squared)) %>%
ggplot(aes(model, r2)) +
	geom_col(aes(fill = model)) +
	facet_wrap(~content) +
	guides(fill = "none") +
	scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

---
# Unnesting

* Sometimes you just want to `unnest`

--

* Imagine we want to plot the coefficients by model... how?

--
* `broom::tidy()` => `tidyr::unnest()`



---
# Tidy

```{r tidy}
mods %>%
	gather(model, output, m1:m3) %>%
	mutate(tidied = map(output, broom::tidy))
```

---
# Select and unnest

```{r tidied}
tidied <- mods %>%
	gather(model, output, m1:m3) %>%
	mutate(tidied = map(output, broom::tidy)) %>%
	select(content, model, tidied) %>%
	unnest()
tidied
```

---
# Plot
### Lets look how the primary coefficients change

```{r coef-plot-echo, eval = FALSE}
to_plot <- names(coef(mods$m1[[1]]))

tidied %>%
	filter(term %in% to_plot) %>%
ggplot(aes(estimate, term, color = model)) +
	geom_point() +
	scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
	facet_wrap(~content)
```

---
```{r coef-plot-eval, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 9}
to_plot <- names(coef(mods$m1[[1]]))

tidied %>%
	filter(term %in% to_plot) %>%
ggplot(aes(estimate, term, color = model)) +
	geom_point() +
	scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set2") +
	facet_wrap(~content)

```

---
# Last bit
* We've kind of been running the wrong models this whole time

* We forgot about grade!

* No problem, just change the grouping factor

---
# By grade

```{r by_grade}
by_grade_content <- d %>%
	nest(-content, -grade)
by_grade_content
```

---
# Fit models

```{r by_grade_mods}
mods_grade <- by_grade_content %>%
	mutate(m1 = map(data, ~lm(Theta ~ primary, data = .x)),
         m2 = map(data, ~lm(Theta ~ primary + secondary, data = .x)),
         m3 = map(data, ~lm(Theta ~ primary * secondary, data = .x)))
mods_grade
```

---
# Look at $R^2$

```{r by_grade_r2}
mods_grade %>%
	gather(model, output, m1:m3) %>%
	mutate(r2 = map_dbl(output, ~summary(.x)$r.squared))
```

---
# Plot

```{r by_grade_r2_plot-echo, eval = FALSE}
mods_grade %>%
	gather(model, output, m1:m3) %>%
	mutate(r2 = map_dbl(output, ~summary(.x)$r.squared)) %>%
ggplot(aes(model, r2)) +
	geom_col(aes(fill = model)) +
	facet_grid(grade ~ content) +
	guides(fill = "none") +
	scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```

---
```{r by_grade_r2_plot-eval, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 9.5}
mods_grade %>%
	gather(model, output, m1:m3) %>%
	mutate(r2 = map_dbl(output, ~summary(.x)$r.squared)) %>%
ggplot(aes(model, r2)) +
	geom_col(aes(fill = model)) +
	facet_grid(grade ~ content) +
	guides(fill = "none") +
	scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set2")
```
