# Labs
#### 16% of your overall grade
#### 40 points total; 10 points each

You are encouraged to work in partners or teams of up to 4 people on labs.
However, should you choose to work in teams, labs **must** be submitted as a
shared GitHub repository. I will evaluate the commits made by team members
before assigning final points.

More details will be available later in the term, but a midterm will be 
assigned, which will likely ask you to rewrite code to accomplish a similar 
task using more efficient and/or readable approaches.
