<h1>Course Overview</h1>
<p>This is the third course in the <em>data science in educational research</em> specialization. This course builds upon the content covered in the first two courses, with a specific focus on becoming a better programmer and improving workflows in statistical computing with R. Students will continue to work with the <a href="https://www.tidyverse.org">tidyverse</a> suite of packages, with a emphasis on <a href="https://purrr.tidyverse.org">{purrr}</a> for functional programming. At its core, functional programming is a technique to iterate a function over a vector, or set of vectors, to complete repetitive tasks. We will compare and contrast {purrr} functions with base R approaches, including <code>for</code> loops and the <code>apply</code> family of functions. Functional programming helps reduce redundancies in code, making it more efficient and, often, more readable. The course will also cover writing custom functions, which can also help in completing repetitive tasks, but can also extend the functionality of R, and is a key component of functional programming. The course concludes with a brief introduction to <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">shiny</a> for building interactive applications which, although somewhat outside of the scope of functional programming, requires using and writing functions.</p>
<div id="student-learning-objectives" class="section level2">
<h2>Student Learning objectives</h2>
<p>By the end of this course, students should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand and be able to describe the differences in R’s data structures (including the four main vector types, data frames, lists) and when each is most appropriate for a given task</li>
<li>Explore <code>purrr::map</code> and its variants, how they relate to base R functions, and why the {purrr} variants are often preferable.</li>
<li>Work with lists and list columns using <code>purrr::nest</code> and <code>purrr:unnest</code></li>
<li>Fit multiple (basic) models using the <a href="https://broom.tidyverse.org">{broom}</a> package with {purrr}</li>
<li>Convert repetitive tasks into functions</li>
<li>Understand elements of good functions, and things to avoid</li>
<li>Write effective and clear functions to continue with the mantra of “Don’t Repeat Yourself”</li>
</ul>

<h1>Assignments</h1>
<div id="labs-40-points-16" class="section level2">
<h2>Labs (40 points; 16%)</h2>
<p>There are 4 labs during the course. All labs will be scored on a “best honest effort” basis, which generally implies zero or full credit (i.e., the assignment was or was not fully completed). However, labs may require students complete specific portions before moving on to the next sections. If you find yourself stuck and unable to proceed, <strong>please contact the instructor for help rather than submitting incomplete work</strong>. Contacting the instructor is part of the “best honest effort”, and can result in full credit for an assignment even if the the work is not fully complete. <strong>If the assignment is not complete, and the student has not contacted the instructor for help or visited office hours, it is likely to result is a partial credit score or a zero</strong>. Labs submitted late will be docked by 30% (3 points).</p>
</div>
<div id="datacamp-10-points-4" class="section level2">
<h2>DataCamp (10 points; 4%)</h2>
<p>As mentioned above, we will utilize DataCamp for this course. You must complete at least one DataCamp course during the term. You may select any of the following courses, which I have split into the first and last 5 weeks of the term. You may earn up to 10 points extra credit by completing at least one DataCamp module in each half of the term.</p>

</div>
<div id="midterm-50-points-20" class="section level2">
<h2>Midterm (50 points; 20%)</h2>
<p>As may be obvious from the weekly structure, this course is rather split into iterations, and writing/building functions. The final project should incorporate both elements (as described below), but we will also have a midterm that focuses primarily on iteration (perhaps with some data type/coercion involved as well). More details will be available later in the term, but you are likely to be asked to rewrite code to accomplish a similar task using more efficient and/or readable approaches.</p>
</div>
<div id="final-project-150-points-60" class="section level2">
<h2>Final Project (150 points; 60%)</h2>
<p>The final project in this class is a group project, requiring students use a publicly available “real world” dataset, collaborate through <em>git</em>/GitHub, and demonstrate the use of functional programming and writing custom functions. <strong>Students who do not have access to data should plan to meet with the instructor as soon as possible so a dataset can be provided</strong>. If making your data publicly available is a problem for you, please contact the instructor as soon as possible. We can work together to either find a dataset that will work for you, or simulate a dataset that is similar to the data you’d like to work with in reality (and then all your code should work for the real dataset, but you can share the simulated data with your classmates). Students are required to work in groups of 2-4 people. The final assignment is assigned during the first class, and <strong>groups must be finalized by the end of Week 2</strong> (at which point students who have not self-selected into groups will be assigned by the instructor).</p>
<p>The specific format of the final project is open, but generally will be one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brief, reproducible, APA manuscript</li>
<li>Dashboard (flex dashboard or shiny dashboard)</li>
<li>Shiny application</li>
<li>Blog post(s)</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternative formats are also allowable, but should be discussed and approved by the instructor.</p>
<p>There are <strong>two basic approaches</strong> you may take for the final project.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Write code that builds toward a cumulative product (e.g., a data product for a client, a research article, or similar).</p></li>
<li><p>A tutorial (or series of tutorials) on functional programming and writing functions in R.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The former would likely be best suited to one of the first three options listed above, while the former is best suited for a blog post or, perhaps preferably, a series of blog posts. Note that you could also easily combine formats - e.g., a blog post that includes a shiny app or a dashboard.</p>
<div id="outline-10-points-5-due-may-1" class="section level3">
<h3>Outline (10 points; 5%; <strong>Due May 1</strong>)</h3>
<p>At the end of Week 5, you must include a proposal of your final project. It should specifically identify:</p>
<ul>
<li>The chosen format(s)</li>
<li>Whether the purpose will primarily be instructive (tutorial-style) or substantive</li>
<li>Description of the data source (must be publicly available)</li>
<li>Lingering questions (is there anything that gives you pause in terms of how your final project will address all the grading requirements)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Draft Data Preparation Script (20 points)</h3>
<div id="due-by-1000-am-may-27" class="section level5">
<h5>Due by 10:00 am, May 27</h5>
<p>By the beginning of Week 9, you must have a draft of your final project complete, with the vast majority, if not all, of the components listed in the grading criteria present. This script is expected to still be a work in progress and it is expected there will still be pieces you are working on. But the majority should be there. This script will be distributed to your peers for feedback.</p>
</div>

<div id="peer-review-of-data-preparation-script-20-points" class="section level3">
<h3>Peer Review of Data Preparation Script (20 points)</h3>
<div id="due-by-1000-am-june-3" class="section level5">
<h5>Due by 10:00 am, June 3</h5>
<p>Following the submission of the data preparation scripts, you will be assigned to review your peers code. The purpose of this exercise is to learn from each other. Programming is an immensely open-ended enterprise and there are lots of winding paths that all ultimately end up at the same destination. During your peer review, you must note the following three elements.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>At least three areas of strength</p></li>
<li><p>At least one thing you learned from reviewing their script</p></li>
<li><p>At least one and no more than three areas for improvement</p></li>
</ol>
<p>To conduct your review, you are required to fork the group’s repository, provide a comprehensive review with commits on your fork, then submit a pull request so the group can easily see the changes you made and choose whether to merge them or not.</p>
<p>Making your code publicly available can feel daunting. The purpose of this portion of the final project is to help us all learn from each other, not to denigrate. <strong>Under no circumstances will negative comments be tolerated</strong>. Any comments that could be perceived as negative, and outside the scope of the code, will result in an immediate score of zero. Be constructive in your feedback. Be kind. We are all learning.</p>

<h3>Final product grading (100 points)</h3>
<div id="due-by-1159-pm-june-12" class="section level5">
<h5>Due by 11:59 PM, June 12</h5>
<p>Below are the required components of the final project and the points associated with each component. Note that it is assumed that in order to meet all requirements of the final projects some the use cases may be a bit artificial. This is completely acceptable. It is important to recognize that this is a final project for a class, not a “real” product, and these elements must be present to demonstrate that you learned the content.</p>
<ul>
<li>No code is used repetitively (no more than twice) [10 points]</li>
<li>More than one variant of <code>purrr::map</code> is used [10 points]</li>
<li>At least one {purrr} function outside the basic <code>map</code> family (<code>walk_*</code>, <code>reduce</code>, <code>modify_*</code>, etc.) [10 points]</li>
<li>At least one instance of parallel iteration (e.g., <code>map2_*</code>, <code>pmap_*</code>) [10 points]</li>
<li>At least one use case of <code>purrr::nest %&gt;% mutate()</code> [10 points]</li>
<li>At least two custom functions [20 points; 10 points each]
<ul>
<li>Each function must be “pure” unless it is clear that it should have side effects (e.g., a plotting function)</li>
<li>Each function must do exactly one thing</li>
<li>The functions <strong>may</strong> replicate the behavior of a base function - as noted above this is about practicing the skills you learn in class</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Code is fully reproducible and housed on GitHub [10 points]</li>
<li>No obvious errors in chosen output format [10 points]</li>
<li>Deployed on the web and shareable through a link [10 points]</li>
</ul>
<p>I will investigate the commits made by different authors when evaluating the final project. If it is obvious that one person did not utilize GitHub, and instead added all of their contributions through a single or only a few commits, I will dock points from that individual. There should be numerous commits by each author, and they should be roughly even in terms of contribution activity (which GitHub has metrics to track, both in terms of the number of commits as well as the number of lines modified).</p>

<h1>Attendance and Absence Guidelines</h1>
<p>Attendance at all class and discussion groups is expected and required, as described above.</p>
<p>Students must contact the instructor in case of illness or emergencies that preclude attending class sessions. Messages can be left on the instructor’s voice mail or e-mail at any time of the day or night, prior to class. If no prior arrangements have been made before class time, the absence will be unexcused. Excused absences will involve make-up assignments, with make-up assignment procedures to be discussed in class on the first day.</p>
<p>If you are unable to complete an assignment due to a personal and/or family emergency, you should contact your instructor or discussion leader as soon as possible. On a case-by-case basis, the instructor will determine whether the emergency qualifies as an excused absence.</p>
</div>
<div id="expected-classroom-behavior" class="section level1">
<h1>Expected Classroom Behavior</h1>
<p>Students are expected to participate in classroom activities. If use of digital devices or engagement in other non-class activities during class for purposes not regarding classroom activities is critically necessary, the student should engage in these activities while on break, or check with the instructor to arrange for a 10-minute break for unusual circumstances, but only if critically necessary.</p>

<h1>Course Policies</h1>
<div id="diversity-equity-and-inclusion" class="section level2">
<h2>Diversity, Equity and Inclusion</h2>
<p>It is the policy of the University of Oregon to support and value equity and diversity and to provide inclusive learning environments for all students. To do so requires that we:</p>
<ul>
<li>respect the dignity and essential worth of all individuals.</li>
<li>promote a culture of respect throughout the University community.</li>
<li>respect the privacy, property, and freedom of others.</li>
<li>reject bigotry, discrimination, violence, or intimidation of any kind.</li>
<li>practice personal and academic integrity and expect it from others.</li>
<li>promote the diversity of opinions, ideas and backgrounds which is the lifeblood of the university.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this course, class discussions, projects/activities and assignments will challenge students to think critically about and be sensitive to the influence, and intersections, of race, ethnicity, nationality, documentation status, language, religion, gender, socioeconomic background, physical and cognitive ability, sexual orientation, and other cultural identities and experiences. Students will be encouraged to develop or expand their respect and understanding of such differences.</p>
<p>Maintaining an inclusive classroom environment where all students feel able to talk about their cultural identities and experiences, ideas, beliefs, and values will not only be my responsibility, but the responsibility of each class member as well. Behavior that disregards or diminishes another student will not be permitted for any reason. This means that no racist, ableist, transphobic, xenophobic, chauvinistic or otherwise derogatory comments will be allowed. It also means that students must pay attention and listen respectfully to each other’s comments.</p>
</div>
<div id="documented-disability" class="section level2">
<h2>Documented Disability</h2>
<p>Appropriate accommodations will be provided for students with documented disabilities. If you have a documented disability and require accommodation, arrange to meet with the course instructor within the first two weeks of the term. The documentation of your disability must come in writing from the Accessible Education Center in the Office of Academic Advising and Student Services. Disabilities may include (but are not limited to) neurological impairment, orthopedic impairment, traumatic brain injury, visual impairment, chronic medical conditions, emotional/psychological disabilities, hearing impairment, and learning disabilities. For more information on Accessible Education Center, please see <a href="http://aec.uoregon.edu" class="uri">http://aec.uoregon.edu</a></p>
