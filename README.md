# Course 3: Statistical Computing in R
This repository will house all the materials for the third course in the data science specialization using R, developed for the UO COE.

## Learning objectives
* Assess the differences in R's data structures (vectors, data frames, lists) and when each is most appropriate
* Understand and be able to work with lists and list columns
* Convert repetitive tasks into functions and test them for effectiveness
* Understand what makes a good function and good assertions on parameters
* Understand `purrr::map` and its variants
	+ Understand how `purrr::map` differs from base functions, and why its preferable
* Work with `sqllite` in R to understand databases
* Join data together using databases
* Investigate ways to interface `dplyr` with databases

<!--	
* Use linear regression as a basic model and evaluate its limitations
* Work with `purrr::nest`ed data frames, specifically within the context of fitting multiple models
* Compare and contrast the `group_by()` + `summarize()` approach with the `unnest()`/`map()` approach
-->
